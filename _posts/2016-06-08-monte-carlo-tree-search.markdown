`#TDD #Monte Carlo`

This posts continues the discussion of my reversi project. Source code can [be found here](https://github.com/alan-conway/Reversi) and if you'd like to download and play the game then you can do so by [clicking here](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/alan-conway/reversi/artifacts/Reversi.zip?branch=master&job=Configuration%3A+Release)

Here I will discuss using monte carlo tree search as an AI algorithm in the game.
